In Objective-C, a common yet subtle error arises from the misuse of `retain`, `release`, and `autorelease` within memory management.  Consider this scenario:

```objectivec
@interface MyClass : NSObject
@property (nonatomic, retain) NSString *myString;
@end

@implementation MyClass
- (void)dealloc {
    [myString release];
    [super dealloc];
}
@end

// ... elsewhere in your code ...
MyClass *myObject = [[MyClass alloc] init];
myObject.myString = [[NSString alloc] initWithString:@"Hello"];
[myObject release]; //Potential memory leak
```

The problem lies in how `myString` is handled.  While `myObject` is released, the `myString` object retains a reference to the string, preventing its deallocation.  The `release` in `dealloc` only handles the object's internal reference; the externally assigned `myString` still needs to be released before `[myObject release];`.
